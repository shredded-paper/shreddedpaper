    <h3>(Mostly) Unbiased Media.</h3>
    <p>
      Everything these days is owned by "Mister Megacorp Cuck Mike" has no
      heart, soul, or actual content whatsoever. It's all just vapid slop, made
      to appeal to the parent company but also made to tread the fine line of
      inoffensive and boring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is just a small side-project to get my thoughts out in
      writing, practice my writing skills and have a little bit of fun along the
      way. I'm not here to pander or appeal to a certain political belief, this
      exists only to spread the word and info on injustices in our world (Or
      whatever i feel like writing about).
    </p>

    <h3>"Trusted" News.</h3>
    <p>
      Straight to the point, no bullshit, no filler, no ads. All those bells and
      whistles that pad your 300 word article covered in ads and glazing usually
      used? All gone. Say hello to actual provocative content.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not qualified whatsoever in any capcity, but hey, gotta start
      somewhere eh?
    </p>

    <h3>Newsletter.</h3>
    <p>
      Articles (or whatever you'd like to call it) will be published
      approximately whenever i feel like it. If you have any topics or tips
      you'd like me to touch on, or simply want to send me some hatemail, send 
      a message to help@shreddedpaper.ca.
    </p>
